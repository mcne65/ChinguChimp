* Follow the instructions below to test out each command

### The Update Command
##### Learn how to use the /update command

* Call the help guide
    * command: `/update help 1` for the first version
        * version 1 is a longer guide that displays all of the sub-guides at once.
    * command: `/update help 2` for the second version
        * version 2 contains the general information about the command as well as instructions on how to call the sub-guides
    * note: both versions respond to the sub-guides commands
* After reading the help guide send a seperate message into the channel for each of the following questions:
    * [1] Did you prefer version 1 or version 2?
    * [2] Was the guide clear or is there anything you are still confused about?
    * [3] Was the guide structured in an intuitive way or can you suggest moving any items or changing the markdown?
    * [4] Any other suggestions / alternatives / complaints / bugs?

##### Use the /update command
List of update items: `blog, certifications, gitHub, picture, portfolio, projects, skills, story`
* Update one of each item using appropriate flags as needed
    * if you make a mistake you should receive an error message explaining how to fix it.
    * If you dont receive an error response for your erroneous command send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
    * if you forget which flags or the format you can also call the sub-guide for that item at any time.

* After using the /update command and (hopefully) failing in breaking it send a seperate message into the channel for each of the following questions:
    * [1] Was the git-style interface intuitive / convenient to you or do you have an alternative approach to updating you would like to suggest?
    * [2] Were the error messages clear and heplful in fixing your error?
    * [3] Any other suggestions / alternatives / complaints / bugs?

##### Break the /update command
* please try _anything_ you can to break the /update command
* if you do not receive an error message for your attempt send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
* If the command returns something unexepcted send a message with the command you entered and any additional notes.
